# Nixie tube spectrum analyser

I have designed an audio spectrum analyser that breaks an audio signal down into 7 frequency bands and displays each band on an in13 nixie tube. My project has Wifi allowing for smart home control. My project has a volume (changes sensitivity) and a brightness potentiometer. Each PCB takes a single audio signal input and 2 can be used for full stereo.

## Assembly instructions.

First manufacture and assemble the PCB according to the KiCad files. Next 3d print the top and bottom parts of the case. place the PCB onto the standoffs of the case with layer B (with the least components) facing upwards. Place the top of the case on and screw all part onto the standoffs. Laser cut the Wrap around and glue it to the bottom areas of the case while wrapping around the case to give a wooden front finish.
